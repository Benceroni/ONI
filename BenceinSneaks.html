<h3>Puss in boots</h3>
<p><em>7 February 2023</em></p>
<p><em>This might be the first website I'm actually making for myself.</em></p>
<p>
This isn't really about puss in boots. It's about me.<br>
A couple different friends had said puss in boots was really good. I think that got to me. A couple things came together actually. I've been thinking alot about how watching movies benefits me. like games there seems to be something special about the medium of movies.<BR><BR>
I decided to watch puss in boots today. I decided I would go alone, too. I had plans up until 8 so I was set on 9:15. Something changed in my plans. I'm not sure what. Perhaps deciding to go alone helped me to feel free to throw out invitations for others to come. Nobody could ruin my plans by saying no. So I did. I invited one friend who had told me they had a bunch of stuff to get done. I figured it would be a no (not even sure if they really want to spend time with me) but I also know how it feels to get invited to stuff. Sometimes it's bitter to miss out but I wasn't worried about producing that feeling there. I didn't think it would happen. So I invited the friend and they was busy. I hoped it felt good to be thought of and invited though.<br>
I decided to invite another friend. One I'm interested in and should be over but I'm not. She said she had other plans I think. I thought about her a lot during the movie though. Especially when my boy puss gets the girlüòç haha.<br>To boil the message of the movie down to it's most simple message, it's about living your life. Being happy with what you have. Finding joy in the journey. I think those are cookie cutter answers that aren't self explanitory. I don't think i have any better way to describe it. This might be a circular examination of the message, repeated in boiled down mantras that mean a lot more to me. In the movie, puss finds out that he can and should be happy with the shawty softpaws. I find it ironic that the message that built and crescendoed and rang out in my mind was one of being happy alone. So much of what I think about when working towards my goals is attracting a partner. Not to say I'm wrong about achieving my goals and that making me more attractive. But that's just adding another step to "I want a romantic relationship and need it to be happy". It occured to me that I need to pursue programming and building up my business for the sake of me. For my satisfaction. For my purpose. Not vanity. Not appearance. The kind of action that leads to quiet confidence. Side bar in my thinking. This could be incredibly cringe later. That's fine. Cringing on the past means you've grown<BR>sidebar over. <BR>
<BR>
I don't think i have good reason to be interested in this girl. i don't feel like she finds me very funny. I don't feel like she enjoys talking to me. If i'm being honest I can't say I enjoy talking with her. But there she is. In my thoughts. Maybe she possesses this peace in lonliness. Maybe I find that attractive. Maybe that thought will and should die on the vine.
