<h3>blade runner 2019</h3>
<p><em>üëç</em></p>
<p>
    Some of the visual effects are outdated but the movie seems to hold up really well. funny looking bullet wounds still do the job.  
</p>
<p>    I thought there were some clever visual story telling points. Example being after the replicant almost kills him and Rachel comes in clutch, he takes a sip of some alcohol and because the glass and drink are clear and the shot is backlit, you can see the blood flow into the drink after he takes a sip.</p>
<p>    I got what I thought I would theme wise. "Empathy Propaganda". <br>
    I think the movie brings up some questions worth asking-<br>
    what does it mean to be human?<br>
    How should death affect the way we choose to live?<br>
    How much of a baddie was Rachel for 1982?<br>
    Why isn't ryan gosling in this film?<br></p>
    <p>    Some of the movie lost me. how he got from the snake to the first replicant didn't make too much sense to me. I couldn't hear everything perfectly though and the spanish captions were a bit distracting.</p>
    <p>    Movies like this fall in a funny place for me. I didn't find the original bladerunner fun or entertaining in the way that I find my favorite movies but I enjoyed watching it a lot. I loved the expereince of watching it because it showed me something new. It's someone's favorite movie out there and there's a reason people love it. I love trying things that other people love that I don't understand to try and see what they see. I'm glad i've learned to love movies like this.</p>
    <p>    This movie makes me really want to watch 2049 again.</p>
<br><br><br>
    <p>bladerunner 2049</p> 
    <br><br><br>
    <p>    I think 2049 does what the original sets out to do but better. it speaks not only to what experience means and what experiences are real but to a sense of purpose and calling in life. Everyone sees themselves as the chosen one in a way. We all see ourselves as the protaganist.</p>
    <p>
        My bias:<br>
        I saw 2049 first. I knew some of the ending of blade runner 2019 before watching. I had heard that watching it improves the viewing experience of 2049 but isn't required and isn't as good of a movie.
        I generally don't like old movies.</p>
