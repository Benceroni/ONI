<h3>1989 notes</h3>
<p>I was wrong- heard the really popular ones before. 5 of them.</p>
<p>I'm starting to see the web of connections in Taylor's music. The picture is starting to be painted for me. Understanding a reference to another song helps deepen the ideas of both songs.</p>

    <h3>Welcome to new york:</h3>
    <p>new york kinda seems like a hellhole (save it be long island)but song is goodüëç</p>
    <h3>blank space:</h3>
    <p>I just remember my brother playing this over and over and over in 2015 or 16. Very familiar with it as a result. Feels really pop-y and that's sort of a turn off but I enjoy it.</p>
    <h3>Style:</h3>
    <p>first minute: fantastic<br>
      The chorus: i've heard to death.<Br>
      I can't help but really enjoy the other parts though</p>
      <h3>out of the woods:</h3>
      <p>see comments below</p>
        <h3>all you had to do was stay:</h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Shake it off:</h3>
        <p>üòêüòêüòê hard to enjoy</p>
        <h3>I wish you would:
        </h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Bad Blood:</h3>
        <p>also heard this one a good bit before.\</p>
        <h3>Widest dreams:</h3>
        <p>familiar with this one too but I like it now after actually listening to the lyrics.</p>
        <h3>How to get the girl:</h3>
        <img src="images/how_you_get_the_girl.jpg" alt="Severe copium">
        <p>fr tho- This song's bumpin. Love the sound of it.</p>
        <h3>This love</h3>
        <p>I can't remember this song.</p>
        <h3>I know places</h3>
        <p>I like the aesthetic but I don't understand what it's about.</p>
        <h3>Clean:</h3>
        <p>Also can't remember this song. Maybe I'll appreciate it later.</p>
        <h3>Wonderland and you are in love</h3>
        <p>again- haven't gotten caught in my head yet.</p>
        <h3>New romantics:</h3>
        <p>favorite lyric- "the best people in life are free"</p>
      <h4><em>Still the 12th but no longer 1989</em></h4>
      <h3>Mean:</h3>
      <p>Too country for me. but this lyric "But you don't know what you don't know" calls me back to this idea- "Remember that what you do not yet know is more important than what you already know". That being brought to mind felt good.</p>
      <h3>Cardigan:</h3>
      <p>
        Makes me think about learning how old taylor swift and it clicking how young she was when she became a hit and started releasing professional music. That's really impressive.<br>
        The part I care a lot more about is the part where the cardigan is mentioned.<br>
        <em>"And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite"</em><br>
That seems like the heart of romantic love. Feeling like you're someone's #1 pick- in spite of your flaws. This song really pricks that for me emotionally.

<br>The song also explores a place where someone isn't whole hearted in his or her pursuit of loving someone else- or maybe more accurately isn't willing to give up all other potential love for a single person.
<br>The peter pan reference later in the song feels perfect. Peter pan wouldn't give up his potential for a something real- a relationship with wendy and he ended up with nothing real as a result. He never grew up. </p>

<h3>Bence‚Äôs midnight notes (started at 12:46pm on 25 October 2022 and probably more about 3am version)</h3>
<p><em> Ammended 5 November 2022</em></p>
<p>Pre (review) Fit check:
</p>
<img src="images/5nov2022/image0 (18).jpeg" alt="pre fit check">
<p>(Got the good headphones on)</p>
<p>Writing refines ideas. Taylor swift feels like brand new. But from a perspective I‚Äôm unfamiliar with. Like looking at something from a different angle- or seeing someone‚Äôs painting of the same object from a different angle. I don‚Äôt understand why but it feels like there‚Äôs something of value to learn in her music. In listening to it I often crave something i‚Äôm more familiar with and go listen to brand new to get the dose of order and familiar I seek while swimming in a sea of new and unfamiliar.
    That different angle feels like a glimpse into the feminine. 
    I don‚Äôt need to view these songs looking for meaning anymore than i naturally do. I didn‚Äôt set out listening to brand new looking for meaning. I listened to it because it was good music. I stuck around because it means something. I should allow the t swizzle experience to wash over me. A sort of paradoxical desire, like trying to relax. Maybe it‚Äôs better to look at it through the lens of action and the negative. I can stop trying to beat the meaning out of it through brute force listening. </p>

    <p>I wrote these last 2 paragraphs last week. I still thing they're true.</p>

        <p>9 November 2022 (I'm very tired rn dawg)</p>
        <h3>Out of the woods:</h3>
        <p>"we took a polaroid"</p>
        <img src="images/572vjn.jpg" alt="leo pointing with a drink a cigarette idk if i'll get it in.">
        <h3>Betty:</h3>
        <p>Cute. the lyric about kissing reminds me of a song from midnights but I can't remember which one- Question..?. That‚Äôs the one.</p>
        <h3>Question..?:</h3>
        <p>I really like it until the part where she mentions people clapping about a hypothetical kiss. Really takes me out of the music and makes me feel childish for listening and liking it.</p>
        <h3>Tolerate it:</h3>
        <p>Heartbreaking. Good picture of what being in love with the memory or idea of someone i think?</p>
        <h3>August:</h3>
        <p>I thought I liked it more the first time i listened. Sounds like a damaging way to love someone. </p>
        <h3>‚ÄòTis the (i still feel guilt about that) season:</h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3>My tears ricochet:</h3>
        <p>billie eilish vibes fr- especially in the long pond studio version
          Keep going back to this one. I like it better when I don't think about what it's actually about.</p>
        <h3>Willow:</h3>
        <p>Trying to bend and twist reality, especially through deception and lying, doesn‚Äôt work. It always snaps back<br>
          Another, more likely take. Some people seem to get all they need or want too. I haven‚Äôt picked up on the follow up from her perspective of what life is like for him now. It seems like she wants to gat caught up and fit into his perfect life. 
          90‚Äôs trend reference kills me. The one part of the song that doesn‚Äôt feel timeless.</p>
        <h3>No body, No crime:</h3>
        <p>Love the feel of this song. Lyrics about a murder and the story of such? Fun. haha. Easier for me to understand where the song is being written from. Reminds me of brand new. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="review">
        <p>also 5 November 2022</p>
        <h3>Maroon:</h3>
        <p>lots of feet references?</p>
        <img src="images/5nov2022/smirkingdoge.jpg" alt="mmmm feet">

<div class="review">
    <p>5 November 2022</p>
    <h3>High infidelity:</h3>
    <p>Probably the first song I really latched onto. Has some deep truths that resonate with me. Primarily the idea that the relationship some married people have with each-other can primarily be painted (descried) as thinly veiled resentment, animosity, and petty acts of revenge. All while mouthing platitudes of love. I don‚Äôt know if the song really dives that far into resentment in relationships. It could be more about unintentional neglect and opportunity cost.</p>
    <h3>Glitch</h3>
    <p>Really pretty song melodically. The dissonance always catches me and pulls the full weight of my full attention when It starts. The lyrics make me feel funny. Like hearing about a game It‚Äôs clear i‚Äôve never fully understood. First song I sang along to?</p>
    <h3>Paris:</h3>
    <p>Lyrics feel clever. The sound of the song doesn‚Äôt feel special.
        I love the lyric about throwing shade and tree shade- and the sound of the song after</p>
    <h3>Lavender haze:</h3>
    <p>Dogma, Tradition, and the expectations of others. Bumpin beat and feels really good to listen to</p>
    <h3>Would‚Äôve should‚Äôve could‚Äôve:</h3>
    <p>Feels like a regretful song- but without true remorse. Like there‚Äôs no true change, or only regretful about the situation and not about choices.</p>
