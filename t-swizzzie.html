      <p>Yesterday I considered why i like brand new so much. I think it’s the fact that it’s withstood the test of time for me. I’ve never gotten sick of the songs that I like most from them. I also recognized that the songs aren’t glued to a specific place in time for me. <BR><bR>Some songs are listened to way too much over too short a time. Making the listener fatigued and the song pinned inexorably to the feelings and memories of that brief burnout period.
        
        <br><br>Brand new has ties to lots of different memories for me over time. Different places where I felt i had found something new to love or made a new connection, and i'm consistently making new ones.</p>

      <div class="title">-Waste- </div>
      <p>Sitting close to the top of my brand new favorites list right now. </p>
      <p>I’ve heard this song is a message to a former self. I never made that connection on my own but:<br>
        “You and I are stuck like glue and that’s the… truth” is compelling for that idea. And I think the song is better for it.
      </p>
        <p class="justifyleft"><em>“I’m hoping that in time you can lay down all this weight you’ve been caring around”</em></p>
        <p class="justifyleft">
<em>
          “If it’s breaking your heart, if nothing is fun, don’t lose hope my son. This is the last one.
          <br>Every night had you laid low, it’s gonna feel so good to let it go
          It’s all in your head, your race is run. don’t give up my son. This is the last one.”</em>
          </p>
          <p class="justifyleft"><em>“You are not alone you get to reset”</em></p>
          <p>‘It will get better keep trying’ messages have gotten grating to me. I don’t like them like i used to. Something about this song has an appeal that other messages don’t. I think the message to the self and to the past provides that difference. I can relate to both the sender and intended recipient of this song with where I am right now. It feels like an invitation to visit the place where things are better, here and now. For that, I admire it deeply.</p>
          <div class="spacer2"></div>
          <div class="title">-No control-</div>
          <p>This song undoubtedly feels like it’s about giving up. ‘Life sucks. i’m quitting.’</p>
          <p>My favorite lyric is this:</p>

          <p class="justifyleft"><em>“That's how it goes. But the worst is over, chum and throw me overboard”</em></p>
          <p>(again- I'm a sucker for songs with allegories to ships)<br>That lyric feels so perfect. The way the words click together and rhyme so well in the song. I think it’s a good description of how someone might feel when giving up. ‘I’m not going to destroy myself directly but instead subject myself to that which will.’ Or ‘I don’t want to die but if i was about to get hit by a truck I don’t know if i’d get out of the way’</p>
          <p>There’s more to the song, though but I don’t understand it.<br>
            Maybe it’s small brain- ‘I don’t actually understand the song’ copium but listening as I am now, I think about the degree of difference between giving up on trying and letting go of what you can’t control- and the song has become an encouragement for me to let go of what i cannot change. To me, It’s no longer an anthem to quitting, but a call to be stronger in mind and let go of the outcome</p>
            <div class="spacer2"></div>
            <p class="title">-Sealed to me-</p>
            <p>Probably one of the most intriguing songs (to me) by brand new.Performed live but never recorded and released. A gem only found on YouTube (really scratches the gatekeeping itch in me)</p>
            <p>Putting aside the curiosity of the rest of the song, one lyric has stuck with me.
            </p>
            <p class="justifyleft"><em>“I’m working hard at being my own MVP, instead of feeling lucky just to’ve made your team”</em></p>
            <p>Relying on the value you see in yourself and not in the judgment of others seems like the only way to achieve emotional stability. Focusing on what can be controlled and making the best out of that is noble. It's focus where focus should go.</p>
            <div class="spacer2"></div>
            <p>I think I was right. About being happy and you being right. It must feel good to be right all the time.<br> This page will be scrubbed of brand new content once you've read it.</p>

              <p><em>23 November 2022</em></p>
              <h4>Maroon</h4>
              <p>I noticed another mention of red when she said something about ruby eyes. Felt rewarding to catch that. Gave me a bit more of that feeling I love getting from music. Love it when music makes me feel smart for paying attention to it.</p>
              <h4>Mastermind</h4>
              <p>seems like a really manipulative song. I noticed the lyric <br><em>"This is the first time i've felt the need to confess"</em><br> last week and that made me like the song a lot more. Listening to it now- I can see the story that's being painted. It feels like an admission of manipulation- a confession- as put in the song. I think I really like songs about the acceptance of what is and what has been and recognizing misdeeds and confessing them. 
                She sings about the role women have played in the game of romance over time too- <em>"You see all the wisest women had to do it this way, cause we were born to be the pawn in every lovers game"</em>
                ding ding ding. She's hinted at and nailed something I think is very true. The art of seduction has been probably the most powerful tool for women throughout history. Girlboss. Gaslight. Gatekeep.💁‍♀️<br><br>
                </p>

              <h3>16 November 2022</h3>
              <p>I've reached a point I both expected and feared. I've listened to enough of her music to get bits and pieces stuck in my head but I don't know it well enough to know what song it's from when it plays back in my head and I want to go listen to it🙃.<br>
                I love the ship imagery that Taylor uses too. Evermore and Willow are what remind me of that. Guess i'm a sucker for ship references too.
                </p>

            <div class="island">
              <h3>14 November 2022</h3>
              <p>Today I listened to a lot of evermore and call it what you want. I don’t remember on call it what you want but while listening to evermore i felt goosebumps and a wave of good feeling. Moments like that are so often what I crave listening to music. There’s an idea that beauty and within beauty- music is one pathway to the divine. Maybe that’s what I felt. A sort of connection with the divine. </p>

              <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CkgSzs_vjOm/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y%3D">british "people"</a>
              <h3>Evermore</h3>
              <p>Dang. Bon iver hits different here. The song before that is really nice. A lovely slow song. When he shows up i feel it.
                I don't remember the name for it, but i'm definitly a sucker for songs with multiple vocal parts at once. </p>
              <h3>The best day:</h3>
              <p>Makes me want to be a good dad</p>
              <h3>Tolerate it:</h3>
              <p><em>Where’s the man who threw blankets over my barbed wire</em><br>
                I remember hearing this idea and I can't easily find the source, but it's that people often put up barriers in hopes that the one they love will break them down- even in a non romantic but close relationship. The barrier becomes a test of care. Something to conquer to show love.</p>

            <h3>1989 notes</h3>
            <p>I was wrong- heard the really popular ones before. 5 of them.</p>
            <p>
              I'm starting to see the web of connections in Taylor's music. The
              picture is starting to be painted for me. Understanding a
              reference to another song helps deepen the ideas of both songs.

            <h3>Welcome to new york:</h3>
            <p>
              new york kinda seems like a hellhole (save it be long island)but
              song is good👍
            </p>
            <h3>blank space:</h3>
            <p>
              I just remember my brother playing this over and over and over in
              2015 or 16. Very familiar with it as a result. Feels really pop-y
              and that's sort of a turn off but I enjoy it.
            </p>
            <h3>Style:</h3>
            <p>
              first minute: fantastic<br />
              The chorus: i've heard to death.<br />
              I can't help but really enjoy the other parts though
            </p>
            <h3>out of the woods:</h3>
            <p>see comments below</p>

            <p></p>
            <h3>Shake it off:</h3>
            <p>😐😐😐 hard to enjoy</p>
            <h3>I wish you would:</h3>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Bad Blood:</h3>
            <p>also heard this one a good bit before.\</p>
            <h3>Widest dreams:</h3>
            <p>
              familiar with this one too but I like it now after actually
              listening to the lyrics.
            </p>
            <h3>How to get the girl:</h3>
            <img src="images/how_you_get_the_girl.jpg" alt="Severe copium" />
            <p>fr tho- This song's bumpin. Love the sound of it.</p>
            <h3>This love</h3>
            <p>I can't remember this song.</p>
            <h3>I know places</h3>
            <p>I like the aesthetic but I don't understand what it's about.</p>
            <h3>Clean:</h3>
            <p>
              Also can't remember this song. Maybe I'll appreciate it later.
            </p>
            <h3>Wonderland and you are in love</h3>
            <p>again- haven't gotten caught in my head yet.</p>
            <h3>New romantics:</h3>
            <p>favorite lyric- "the best people in life are free"</p>
            <h4><em>Still the 12th but no longer 1989</em></h4>
            <h3>Mean:</h3>
            <p>
              Too country for me. but this lyric "But you don't know what you
              don't know" calls me back to this idea- "Remember that what you do
              not yet know is more important than what you already know". That
              being brought to mind felt good.
            </p>
            <h3>Cardigan:</h3>
            <p>
              Makes me think about learning how old taylor swift and it clicking
              how young she was when she became a hit and started releasing
              professional music. That's really impressive.<br />
              The part I care a lot more about is the part where the cardigan is
              mentioned.<br />
              <em
                >"And when I felt like I was an old cardigan Under someone's bed
                You put me on and said I was your favorite"</em
              ><br />
              That seems like the heart of romantic love. Feeling like you're
              someone's #1 pick- in spite of your flaws. This song really pricks
              that for me emotionally.

              <br />The song also explores a place where someone isn't whole
              hearted in his or her pursuit of loving someone else- or maybe
              more accurately isn't willing to give up all other potential love
              for a single person. <br />The peter pan reference later in the
              song feels perfect. Peter pan wouldn't give up his potential for a
              something real- a relationship with wendy and he ended up with
              nothing real as a result. He never grew up.

            <p>(Got the good headphones on)</p>
            <p>Writing refines ideas. Taylor swift feels like brand new. But from a perspective I’m unfamiliar with. Like looking at something from a different angle- or seeing someone’s painting of the same object from a different angle. I don’t understand why but it feels like there’s something of value to learn in her music. In listening to it I often crave something i’m more familiar with and go listen to brand new to get the dose of order and familiar I seek while swimming in a sea of new and unfamiliar.
                That different angle feels like a glimpse into the feminine. 
                I don’t need to view these songs looking for meaning anymore than i naturally do. I didn’t set out listening to brand new looking for meaning. I listened to it because it was good music. I stuck around because it means something. I should allow the t swizzle experience to wash over me. A sort of paradoxical desire, like trying to relax. Maybe it’s better to look at it through the lens of action and the negative. I can stop trying to beat the meaning out of it through brute force listening. </p>
            
                <p>I wrote these last 2 paragraphs last week. I still thing they're true.</p>

                    <p>Cute. the lyric about kissing reminds me of a song from midnights but I can't remember which one- Question..?. That’s the one.</p>
                    <h3>Question..?:</h3>
                    <p>I really like it until the part where she mentions people clapping about a hypothetical kiss. Really takes me out of the music and makes me feel childish for listening and liking it.</p>
                    <h3>Tolerate it:</h3>
                    <p>Heartbreaking. Good picture of what being in love with the memory or idea of someone i think?</p>
                    <h3>August:</h3>
                    <p>I thought I liked it more the first time i listened. Sounds like a damaging way to love someone. </p>

                      Keep going back to this one. I like it better when I don't think about what it's actually about.</p>
                    <h3>Willow:</h3>
                    <p>Trying to bend and twist reality, especially through deception and lying, doesn’t work. It always snaps back<br>
                      Another, more likely take. Some people seem to get all they need or want too. I haven’t picked up on the follow up from her perspective of what life is like for him now. It seems like she wants to gat caught up and fit into his perfect life. 
                      90’s trend reference kills me. The one part of the song that doesn’t feel timeless.</p>
                    <h3>No body, No crime:</h3>
                    <p>Love the feel of this song. Lyrics about a murder and the story of such? Fun. haha. Easier for me to understand where the song is being written from. Reminds me of brand new. </p>

                <h3>High infidelity:</h3>
                <p>Probably the first song I really latched onto. Has some deep truths that resonate with me. Primarily the idea that the relationship some married people have with each-other can primarily be painted (descried) as thinly veiled resentment, animosity, and petty acts of revenge. All while mouthing platitudes of love. I don’t know if the song really dives that far into resentment in relationships. It could be more about unintentional neglect and opportunity cost.</p>
                <h3>Glitch</h3>
                <p>Really pretty song melodically. The dissonance always catches me and pulls the full weight of my full attention when It starts. The lyrics make me feel funny. Like hearing about a game It’s clear i’ve never fully understood. First song I sang along to?</p>
                <h3>Paris:</h3>
                <p>Lyrics feel clever. The sound of the song doesn’t feel special.
                    I love the lyric about throwing shade and tree shade- and the sound of the song after</p>
                <h3>Lavender haze:</h3>
                <p>Dogma, Tradition, and the expectations of others. Bumpin beat and feels really good to listen to</p>
                <h3>Would’ve should’ve could’ve:</h3>
                <p>Feels like a regretful song- but without true remorse. Like there’s no true change, or only regretful about the situation and not about choices.</p>
