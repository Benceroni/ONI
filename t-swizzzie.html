<p>Writing refines ideas. Taylor swift feels like brand new. But from a perspective Iâ€™m unfamiliar with. Like looking at something from a different angle- or seeing someoneâ€™s painting of the same object from a different angle. I donâ€™t understand why but it feels like thereâ€™s something of value to learn in her music. In listening to it I often crave something iâ€™m more familiar with and go listen to brand new to get the dose of order and familiar I seek while swimming in a sea of new and unfamiliar.
    That different angle feels like a glimpse into the feminine. 
    I donâ€™t need to view these songs looking for meaning anymore than i naturally do. I didnâ€™t set out listening to brand new looking for meaning. I listened to it because it was good music. I stuck around because it means something. I should allow the t swizzle experience to wash over me. A sort of paradoxical desire, like trying to relax. Maybe itâ€™s better to look at it through the lens of action and the negative. I can stop trying to beat the meaning out of it through brute force listening. </p>

    <p>I wrote these last 2 paragraphs last week. I still thing they're true.</p>
<div class="review">
    <h3>High infidelity:</h3>
    <p>Probably the first song I really latched onto. Has some deep truths that resonate with me. Primarily the idea that the relationship some married people have with each-other can primarily be painted (descried) as thinly veiled resentment, animosity, and petty acts of revenge. All while mouthing platitudes of love. I donâ€™t know if the song really dives that far into resentment in relationships. It could be more about unintentional neglect and opportunity cost.</p>
    <h3>Glitch</h3>
    <p>Really pretty song melodically. The dissonance always catches me and pulls the full weight of my full attention when It starts. The lyrics make me feel funny. Like hearing about a game Itâ€™s clear iâ€™ve never fully understood. First song I sang along to?</p>
    <h3>Paris:</h3>
    <p>Lyrics feel clever. The sound of the song doesnâ€™t feel special.
        I love the lyric about throwing shade and tree shade- and the sound of the song after</p>
    <h3>Lavender haze:</h3>
    <p>Dogma, Tradition, and the expectations of others. Bumpin beat and feels really good to listen to</p>
    <h3>Wouldâ€™ve shouldâ€™ve couldâ€™ve:</h3>
    <p>Feels like a regretful song- but without true remorse. Like thereâ€™s no true change, or only regretful about the situation and not about choices.</p>
