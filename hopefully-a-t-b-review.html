            <h3>19 November 2022</h3>
<p><em>"In as much as ye can send, send."<br>Doctrine and Covenatns Section 66 verse 6</em></p>
<p>Here I am. T minus 1 hour and 40 minutes to sharkooterie borad night. Today I had an idea-(what can only be described as an absolute stroke of divine instpiration)-<BR><strong>Bringing cinnabon delights.</strong><br>
</p>
<p>I checked the app and they weren't even in the breakfast section. SMH my head. I found a link to them when i looked them up and it took me to the app but I couldn't order them even though I could add them to my cart. This whole time looking it up, my mind was punctuated with a memory of seeing a taco bell worker chowing down on them at like 8 pm.<br>
not being able to order them on the app was when I thought I had hit rock bottom. But I had another idea(another divination no doubt) and checked the website. Not only could i look them up on the web app, but i coudld add them to the cart and get to the checkout. This is currently the plan. 
</p>

Here's how the cinnabon delights happened. I carried out the online order plan.<br>The order confirmation screen popped up for a sec then I got a pop up saying the store was closed. I got the email that said my order was being made so I had a glimmer of hope. Then I went and checked my checking account and the money had been withdrawn so i felt good about it. ten minutes later I got the notification on my phone that my order was ready. It felt suspiciouly fast thoughüëÄ so i wasn't sure if it was legit.
I showed up and well- The ending is clear.

    <p>I took one bite and it was cold and gross and it crossed my mind that this meatloaf belongs in my suicide note.

<p>For most of the night I felt disconnected. I was there physically but not socially. It's like there was a social zeitgeist. A social rhythm that almost everyone else was playing and I didn't get it and it hurt because I wanted to be a part of it. <br>
I wanted to be eveloped in the group. It was killing me emotionally. I felt myself degrading. It felt like it would get to the point of crying then needing to leave or put my head down and check out completely.<br> It seems paradoxical how the world works. Desiring -or more accurately chasing something can often be the very thing that leads to it being plucked from our grasp. Chasing a cat to try to pet it almost never works. I tried letting go my desire socially there. It didn't work though. At least not the way I had hoped. <br>Maybe desiring to let go was the problem haha. It's an art. </p>

<p>When I got home this thought clicked that it felt like nothing I really cared about before hand mattered. I still haven't figured out how much that thought is lying to me but I think there's some truth to it.</p>
