            <h3>Cathy's apartment : 3 November 2022 </h3>
            <p><em>(So the missionaries could be there and no other reason)</em></p>
                <p>The pre game ambiance (no true fit check- I didn't thing about writing a review of the experience until it was too late for one):</p>

                <p>(Thought i looked good in this one)</p>
                <p>walking up the stairs was fine. Being greeted by the elders just outside the door- really took me back to the mission.</p>
                <p>(my friend then abandoned me)</p>
<p>The insuing awkwardness also called back memories of texas was plentiful. My only defense: trying to acknowledge and make jokes about it.<br>
the mission is still fresh in my mind. I don't know if I ever got to a point where I was really comfortable in a member's home. I get it's hard. Missions bend you into shape.</p>
<p>Now that i'm done talking about the awkward part:</p>
<div class="review">
  <h4>Broccoli salad:(4/10)</h4>
  <p>Can't remember what's in it- besides broccoli (of course). Didn't particuarly enjoy this. Maybe if the broccoli was cooked a bit before. But it was fresh and real food. I could taste the restorative factors and that definitly took a few points off.</p>

  <h4>Lasagnia (for people who aren't afraid of bread)(still has zucccini for some reason???):(6/10)</h4>
  <p>A passable lasagnia. Was lacking a bit of firmness though. Like there was too much liquid. A solid lasagnia can be sloppy if cut into straight out of the oven. That's ok- we still love it. But if you're a lasagna and can't hold it together after 15 minutes out of the oven then you might as well give up and call youself a casserole. Probably the unwelcomed squash/zuccini thing in there weakening it's stucture. It did taste pretty good though.</p>
  <h4>Colder than room temp water:(9/10)</h4>
  <p>Not ice cold, but when I drank it I didn't get room temp water vibes and that's the thing I run from when i drink cool water. It's kinda the whole point. Drank a ton of this boy. Paid for it later when I had to pee really bad but had already peed like 4 times and thought it might be weird to pee agian.</p>
</div>
<p>After a lesson that took me straight back to the pain of my mission(not hard to do.), the missionaries left and the good time began.</p>
<p>(My friend showed up again btw)</p>
<p>Here's the pre fit check according to my friends:</p>
<img src="https://benceroni.github.io/ONI/images/3Nov2022/image0 (16).jpeg" alt="pre fit check???">
<p>my "friends" were not a fan of my face tonight.</p>
<p>I figured I'd have time tonight to work on new products- maybe play a little more pathologic 2. No. Wrong. I accepted that though and felt good. Talking is always kind of a funny game. Trying to dial in on what comments will produce the biggest funni. What's acceptable or not. How far out the jokes are going. Do I dial in on the line? no. but I try.<br>
  Definitly worth sticking around. and no, I didn't really want to leave.
</p>
<p>Just looked up how to spell lasagna haha well we roll with it.<br><br>-ðŸ…±ence.
