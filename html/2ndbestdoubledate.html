<h3>Double date with Bekah/Joey and Hayley 4 November 2022</h3>
<p>Pre fit check:</p>
<img src="https://benceroni.github.io/ONI/images/4Nov2022/image0 (17).jpeg" alt="(me)(at the house)(chillin)(looking good)">
<p>I thought this photo looked a bit better on my phone just after taking it. Might've retaken it if I had seen it in full resolution haha.</p>

<p>(Currently the music for writing this hasn't been cutting it. Looking for the right mood. Looking for something that brings me to here and now.)</p>

<p>Despite perhaps wishing I had taken another photo, I thought the pre fit check was valid:✅✅✅</p>

<p>[intro goes here. Doesn't feel right to write first?]</p>

<p>The pre game guessing for who Hayley's date would be was- I can't find the right word. A fun puzzle to think out. I did enjoy the theorizing that all proved to be wrong.</p>
<p>When Bekah came to pick me up- she came and rang the doorbell. I enjoyed the other side of that experience. </p>
<p>the drive to the axethrowing place: happened. Don't feel like writing about it.</p>
<p>Axe throwing was fun. Joey (Hayley's date) was a delight👍</p>
<p>Absolutley SMACKED 4 hits in a row on our last game💪(joey won in our sudden death tho)</p>
<!-- <p>The guy in the next lane over reminded me of Phil Spencer (xbox CEO), then I realized he also looks like mads mikkelsen(👀👀👀)</p> -->
<p>Once we finished the throwing of the axe(s), joey had somewhere else to be and decided to deuce out of the date✌✌✌</p>
<p>and so did Hayley✌✌✌ So it was just Bekah and I from there.(an inpromptu setup perhaps🤨🤨🤨(this is where the double date became a real date))</p>
<p>Bekah and I went back to her house- blissfully unaware that Hayley was not coming. once we figured that out we decided to watch a quiet place.</p>
<p>Quiet place didn't really make me feel anything. Kinda the whole point of movies for me. I had never seen it before but I had heard enough about it to the point where nothing surprised me. It seems like a good movie from an analytical point of view but looking back I don't think I really enjoyed the movie itself that much. I bought in to the first two suspenseful moments and I think I disconnected emotionally after that. I don't think I'd watch it again without a good reason. </p>
<p>well. This is the part I get to choose how much of my mind to open up.</p>
<!-- <p>When I think about dates and attraction to people, I think about projecting images onto people. I have a lot of experience falling in love with the idea of someone, or my perfect projection of them- when I don't really know or love them.</p> -->
<p>Bekah is relativly quiet- she isn't very expressive. She can be kind of hard to read too. It seems like she likes me a good bit. She doesn't exibit it much when we interact but that's how I see it. Even if it's wrong, it's the way I saw this interaction. </p>
<p>While we watched le movie, it kept crossing my mind that she probably wouldn't mind if I cuddled up next to her or put my arm around her. Scary to actually do but it was tempting. Especially having never experienced such. I think it would've been a lie though. I don't think i'm interested in her. My actions wouldn't have matched the way I really see things, or what I would consider the truth so I chose not to.</p>
<p>after the movie finished we talked about it. I wasn't super bought into it, but I wanted to hear her take on it. I think that someone being passionate about a movie or piece of media or something of the like can be fascinating. I was hoping to hear something juicy about the movie or why she likes it but that didn't happen. That's ok though.</p>
<p>That end of the night conversation is also the place that real conversations happen frequently. I feel like I did my best to be open and cultivating of one but it didn't happen. We talked for about half an hour and she took me home. </p>
<p>When I think about this situation- with my perception of Bekah liking me- it makes me think about all the times I've been where she's at. Hoping for someone to like you but it just not being there. That's a sucky place to be. A place that can rule your world and emotions if you let it. I seriously don't like the idea of having that guilt pinned on me by me or someone else- but I know lying about it would only make it worse. I also recognize that Bekah's the reason i've been invited to a lot of things.</p>
<p>I think that's it. The best I can put it at this moment.</p>
<p>-🅱ence</p>
<p>in all honesty I considered hitting the bell post date. Didn't happen though.</p>
