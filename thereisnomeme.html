<h3>flashes of light</h3>
<p><em>I'm for sure wandering here</em></p>
<p>
    faith is a funny thing.<br>
    my original problem- caring too much what others think of me. letting my emotions be attached to how I think others see me.
    Looking from my psycological perspective- there's good reason to be sensetive to how others see me. If I destroy my relationships with others or am incredibly unlikable- most of my avenues to success (feeding myself, finding a partner, having fulfilling work) get cut off. <br>
    the presentation on flashes of light talks about the imutable nature of the laws of God and truth.<br>
    I think that fits well with the idea I said earlier. If people don't like us, there's a reason. If we're incredibly unlikable then it would probably pay to be less of a thorn in the side of people we interact with. If none of the girls are interested in me, then the problem probaly isn't the girls, but me
    Sometimes I take this lot of ideas and squish the far edges of each together.<br>
    I forget to leave room for my lack of skill in perception- and the shortcomings of others- and circumstance- and assume every problem I have socializing with others is exclusively my fault. I assume that something about me has to be fixed right now or else i'll never have a good job or feel like I have no friends, or never find a girl who's interested.
    I still think that earlier idea- that the way others treat us shows us how good we are at socializing but it doesn't have to be fixed all at once. Writing now I realize I don't even think there's a ceiling. There's only better because there is always room for improvement. To think that "perfect" must be reached right now destroys the opportunity for improvement via a desire to stop trying all together.<BR>
    I think the flashes of light can be built into this train of thought in the way that improvement in taling to others comes one sentence at a time. One piece of speech at a time. Each word uttered is a something new thrown out into the world to survive and strenghten or wither away and die. I can watch how the words I say get reactions and recalculate and not tell myself I should give up if nothing seems to be working. I think I apply this same perception of others issue to God. I assume that He judges me as harshly as I judge myself and for the same things. I assume he ignores my circumstance. <BR><BR>
        Today at church I offered someone a complment and I don't remember how they replied but I remember experiencing disapointment at their response. In thinking about that I have remembered that I want to do my best and let go of the outcome. That application to my thought process allowed me to see that the compliment reciever may've not known how to respond and that I still want to offer compliments even if I feel like I don't always get a response that makes me feel good.<Br>
