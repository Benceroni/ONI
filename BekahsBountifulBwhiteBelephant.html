<h3>21st december 2022</h3>
<p><em> Written on 21 december 2022. Happened on 21 december 2022</em></p>
<p>
    Last week I knew I had to come up with something juicy for the white elephant. Something funny, personal, but like personal to everyone or at least people i really care about, a hint of desperation, but for the sake of humor. So my mind was set on 3d printing something. <br><br>
    On sunday. Chillin in sacrament meeting. my mind wandering in the world of white elephants and their fruits.  I was pondering my audience. considering the likings of all (or at least the people I really care about) and the office entered into the spotlight of my thoughts. THE DUNDIE AWARD. it was perfect. I could 3d print it. I could put some other stupid message on it instead of the dundie award. When I looked it up that's when I came across the "complaints dept. please take a number" Hand grenade. Not sure if you ever really see that in the show. So i ordered some gold plastic for le 3d printer.<br><br>
    monday, got a sweet shot of president dripthlome(barthlome) and thought about actually doing a framed photo of him for the white elephant but naaaaah my last idea was too perfectüòê
    Today- wednesday- the 21st - the day of ignorance- pulls up. I see the text from Bekah about bringing snacks (which I dutifully did not) during work and looked and saw the state of blissful ignorace i was in about the day of acknowledging the white elephant in the room.<Br><br>
    In the scramble to come up with a new idea my mind went to the discovery I made last night about exclusive(gatekept) songs and I thought the target exclusive cd would be a great thing to bringü§ù. Then I remembered the framed caden photo idea. Whichever I chose it would have to do.<br><br>
    After work, went to my brothers. We worked on the 1997 toyota rav4 (2L front wheel drive, power steering (until december 20 2022)) and moved a fridge.<br><br>
    After that- with an hour to get the picture frame and cd i "hurried" over to target through some terrible mall traffic. It was attrocious.<br><br>The music section of target was ravaged. Nothing in it's right spot. Frankly looking like a walmart shelf. I thought target was supposed to be different. looking, I see zero count em zero (0) midnights cd's. I do find the regular vinly though. I walked away from the music section as discreetly as i could with a midnights vinyl and a bit of self disapointment in my heart. Found the picture frames but they were all way too big. <br>
    I got home and quickly cooked up the israel drip caden meme (not stolen i swear), print it out, tape it on, wrap it up and hustle out. Turns out I didn't have to worry about being late because the party really showed up 35 minutes lateüëç
<BR><br>
    The event itself was draining. Spend all day feeling obligated to be productive [or actually being productive] but having things back to back then going to a party where I didn't feel connected to anyoneüëç nice. <br><br>
    I wanted to stick around and not miss out (because i feared missing out) but I was already late for my date with my 9mmü•∞<Br><br>
        Glad someone who actually likes taylor swift ended up with the vinyl. I hope hayley gets hooked and buys an immense amount of vinyl albums.
