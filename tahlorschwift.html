              <p><em>23 November 2022</em></p>
              <h4>Maroon</h4>
              <p>I noticed another mention of red when she said something about ruby eyes. Felt rewarding to catch that. Gave me a bit more of that feeling I love getting from music. Love it when music makes me feel smart for paying attention to it.</p>
              <h4>Mastermind</h4>
              <p>seems like a really manipulative song. I noticed the lyric <br><em>"This is the first time i've felt the need to confess"</em><br> last week and that made me like the song a lot more. Listening to it now- I can see the story that's being painted. It feels like an admission of manipulation- a confession- as put in the song. I think I really like songs about the acceptance of what is and what has been and recognizing misdeeds and confessing them. 
                She sings about the role women have played in the game of romance over time too- <em>"You see all the wisest women had to do it this way, cause we were born to be the pawn in every lovers game"</em>
                ding ding ding. She's hinted at and nailed something I think is very true. The art of seduction has been probably the most powerful tool for women throughout history. Girlboss. Gaslight. Gatekeep.üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br><br>

              <h3>16 November 2022</h3>
              <p>I've reached a point I both expected and feared. I've listened to enough of her music to get bits and pieces stuck in my head but I don't know it well enough to know what song it's from when it plays back in my head and I want to go listen to itüôÉ.<br>
                I love the ship imagery that Taylor uses too. Evermore and Willow are what remind me of that. Guess i'm a sucker for ship references too.

              <h3>14 November 2022</h3>
              <p>Today I listened to a lot of evermore and call it what you want. I don‚Äôt remember on call it what you want but while listening to evermore i felt goosebumps and a wave of good feeling. Moments like that are so often what I crave listening to music. There‚Äôs an idea that beauty and within beauty- music is one pathway to the divine. Maybe that‚Äôs what I felt. A sort of connection with the divine. </p>

              <h3>Evermore</h3>
              <p>Dang. Bon iver hits different here. The song before that is really nice. A lovely slow song. When he shows up i feel it.
                I don't remember the name for it, but i'm definitly a sucker for songs with multiple vocal parts at once. </p>
              <h3>The best day:</h3>
              <p>Makes me want to be a good dad</p>
              <h3>Tolerate it:</h3>
              <p><em>Where‚Äôs the man who threw blankets over my barbed wire</em><br>
                I remember hearing this idea and I can't easily find the source, but it's that people often put up barriers in hopes that the one they love will break them down- even in a non romantic but close relationship. The barrier becomes a test of care. Something to conquer to show love.</p>

            <h3>1989 notes</h3>
            <p>I was wrong- heard the really popular ones before. 5 of them.</p>
            <p>
              I'm starting to see the web of connections in Taylor's music. The
              picture is starting to be painted for me. Understanding a
              reference to another song helps deepen the ideas of both songs.

            <p>12 November 2022</p>
            <h3>Welcome to new york:</h3>
            <p>
              new york kinda seems like a hellhole (save it be long island)but
              song is goodüëç
            </p>
            <h3>blank space:</h3>
            <p>
              I just remember my brother playing this over and over and over in
              2015 or 16. Very familiar with it as a result. Feels really pop-y
              and that's sort of a turn off but I enjoy it.
            </p>
            <h3>Style:</h3>
            <p>
              first minute: fantastic<br />
              The chorus: i've heard to death.<br />
              I can't help but really enjoy the other parts though
            </p>
            <h3>out of the woods:</h3>
            <p>see comments below</p>
            <h3>all you had to do was stay:</h3>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Shake it off:</h3>
            <p>üòêüòêüòê hard to enjoy</p>
            <h3>I wish you would:</h3>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Bad Blood:</h3>
            <p>also heard this one a good bit before.\</p>
            <h3>Widest dreams:</h3>
            <p>
              familiar with this one too but I like it now after actually
              listening to the lyrics.
            </p>
            <h3>How to get the girl:</h3>
            <img src="images/how_you_get_the_girl.jpg" alt="Severe copium" />
            <p>fr tho- This song's bumpin. Love the sound of it.</p>
            <h3>This love</h3>
            <p>I can't remember this song.</p>
            <h3>I know places</h3>
            <p>I like the aesthetic but I don't understand what it's about.</p>
            <h3>Clean:</h3>
            <p>
              Also can't remember this song. Maybe I'll appreciate it later.
            </p>
            <h3>Wonderland and you are in love</h3>
            <p>again- haven't gotten caught in my head yet.</p>
            <h3>New romantics:</h3>
            <p>favorite lyric- "the best people in life are free"</p>
            <h4><em>Still the 12th but no longer 1989</em></h4>
            <h3>Mean:</h3>
            <p>
              Too country for me. but this lyric "But you don't know what you
              don't know" calls me back to this idea- "Remember that what you do
              not yet know is more important than what you already know". That
              being brought to mind felt good.
            </p>
            <h3>Cardigan:</h3>
            <p>
              Makes me think about learning how old taylor swift and it clicking
              how young she was when she became a hit and started releasing
              professional music. That's really impressive.<br />
              The part I care a lot more about is the part where the cardigan is
              mentioned.<br />
              <em
                >"And when I felt like I was an old cardigan Under someone's bed
                You put me on and said I was your favorite"</em
              ><br />
              That seems like the heart of romantic love. Feeling like you're
              someone's #1 pick- in spite of your flaws. This song really pricks
              that for me emotionally.

              <br />The song also explores a place where someone isn't whole
              hearted in his or her pursuit of loving someone else- or maybe
              more accurately isn't willing to give up all other potential love
              for a single person. <br />The peter pan reference later in the
              song feels perfect. Peter pan wouldn't give up his potential for a
              something real- a relationship with wendy and he ended up with
              nothing real as a result. He never grew up.

            <h3>Bence‚Äôs midnight notes (started at 12:46pm on 25 October 2022 and probably more about 3am version)</h3>
            <p><em> Ammended 5 November 2022</em></p>
            <p>Pre (review) Fit check:
            </p>
            <img src="images/5nov2022/image0 (18).jpeg" alt="pre fit check">
            <p>(Got the good headphones on)</p>
            <p>Writing refines ideas. Taylor swift feels like brand new. But from a perspective I‚Äôm unfamiliar with. Like looking at something from a different angle- or seeing someone‚Äôs painting of the same object from a different angle. I don‚Äôt understand why but it feels like there‚Äôs something of value to learn in her music. In listening to it I often crave something i‚Äôm more familiar with and go listen to brand new to get the dose of order and familiar I seek while swimming in a sea of new and unfamiliar.
                That different angle feels like a glimpse into the feminine. 
                I don‚Äôt need to view these songs looking for meaning anymore than i naturally do. I didn‚Äôt set out listening to brand new looking for meaning. I listened to it because it was good music. I stuck around because it means something. I should allow the t swizzle experience to wash over me. A sort of paradoxical desire, like trying to relax. Maybe it‚Äôs better to look at it through the lens of action and the negative. I can stop trying to beat the meaning out of it through brute force listening. </p>
            
                <p>I wrote these last 2 paragraphs last week. I still thing they're true.</p>

                    <h3>Out of the woods:</h3>
                    <p>"we took a polaroid"</p>
                    <img src="images/572vjn.jpg" alt="leo pointing with a drink a cigarette idk if i'll get it in.">
                    <h3>Betty:</h3>
                    <p>Cute. the lyric about kissing reminds me of a song from midnights but I can't remember which one- Question..?. That‚Äôs the one.</p>
                    <h3>Question..?:</h3>
                    <p>I really like it until the part where she mentions people clapping about a hypothetical kiss. Really takes me out of the music and makes me feel childish for listening and liking it.</p>
                    <h3>Tolerate it:</h3>
                    <p>Heartbreaking. Good picture of what being in love with the memory or idea of someone i think?</p>
                    <h3>August:</h3>
                    <p>I thought I liked it more the first time i listened. Sounds like a damaging way to love someone. </p>
                    <h3>‚ÄòTis the (i still feel guilt about that) season:</h3>
                    <p></p>
                    <h3>My tears ricochet:</h3>
                    <p>billie eilish vibes fr- especially in the long pond studio version
                      Keep going back to this one. I like it better when I don't think about what it's actually about.</p>
                    <h3>Willow:</h3>
                    <p>Trying to bend and twist reality, especially through deception and lying, doesn‚Äôt work. It always snaps back<br>
                      Another, more likely take. Some people seem to get all they need or want too. I haven‚Äôt picked up on the follow up from her perspective of what life is like for him now. It seems like she wants to gat caught up and fit into his perfect life. 
                      90‚Äôs trend reference kills me. The one part of the song that doesn‚Äôt feel timeless.</p>
                    <h3>No body, No crime:</h3>
                    <p>Love the feel of this song. Lyrics about a murder and the story of such? Fun. haha. Easier for me to understand where the song is being written from. Reminds me of brand new. </p>

                <p>5 November 2022</p>
                <h3>High infidelity:</h3>
                <p>Probably the first song I really latched onto. Has some deep truths that resonate with me. Primarily the idea that the relationship some married people have with each-other can primarily be painted (descried) as thinly veiled resentment, animosity, and petty acts of revenge. All while mouthing platitudes of love. I don‚Äôt know if the song really dives that far into resentment in relationships. It could be more about unintentional neglect and opportunity cost.</p>
                <h3>Glitch</h3>
                <p>Really pretty song melodically. The dissonance always catches me and pulls the full weight of my full attention when It starts. The lyrics make me feel funny. Like hearing about a game It‚Äôs clear i‚Äôve never fully understood. First song I sang along to?</p>
                <h3>Paris:</h3>
                <p>Lyrics feel clever. The sound of the song doesn‚Äôt feel special.
                    I love the lyric about throwing shade and tree shade- and the sound of the song after</p>
                <h3>Lavender haze:</h3>
                <p>Dogma, Tradition, and the expectations of others. Bumpin beat and feels really good to listen to</p>
                <h3>Would‚Äôve should‚Äôve could‚Äôve:</h3>
                <p>Feels like a regretful song- but without true remorse. Like there‚Äôs no true change, or only regretful about the situation and not about choices.</p>
